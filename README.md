## Dual-Tone SDR Sync & Calibration System

This project is designed to synchronize multiple LimeSDR-powered nodes using BPSK and dual-tone signaling over RF. It establishes a reliable communication link between a Ground Station, Master Node, and multiple Slave Nodes for frequency offset measurement and calibration.

The system runs on Raspberry Pis each connected to a LimeSDR, and leverages GNU Radio for signal processing.

  Download: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-pi64/
- Python 3.x
- ZMQ, NumPy, SciPy
- *[Add more software dependencies here]*

### üî© Hardware
- 4x Raspberry Pi 4 (or better)
- 4x LimeSDR Mini 2.0
- 4x External Power Bank
- 4x USB-C cables, 4x USB-A male to USB-A female   
- *[Add additional hardware here]*

## üì¶ Setting Up DragonOS

1. Download DragonOS Pi64 image:  
   https://sourceforge.net/projects/dragonos-pi64/

2. Flash it to a microSD card using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)   

3. Boot the Raspberry Pi with the flashed SD card.

4. Log in using default username and password. For DragonOS, the default username is 'ubuntu' and default password is 'dragon'. Most SDR tools (GNU Radio, GQRX, etc.) are already pre-installed.

## üì• Getting the Project Files

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
mkdir -p "Senior Project/Communication Protocol"
cd "Senior Project/Communication Protocol"   
git clone https://github.com/BenDuval/SeniorProject.git   
cd SeniorProject   
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the System

Before running the full protocol, perform an initial setup test to ensure your nodes are functioning properly.   

### üîß Initial Node Test   
1. Boot into DragonOS on each node device.
2. Ensure the LimeSDR is powered on and recognized.
3. Navigate to the cloned project folder:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Senior\ Project/Communication\ Protocol/SeniorProject
```

## üß© System Layout

The system uses three types of nodes:

- **Ground**: Sends Master assignment via BPSK.
- **Master**: Sends commands and performs two-tone offset measurements.
- **Slave**: Echoes dual-tone signals and confirms participation.

Each node communicates using RF at XXX MHz (TX) and XXX MHz (RX), and coordination is handled using ZMQ signaling between scripts.
