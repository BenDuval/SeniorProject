# Dual-Tone SDR Sync & Calibration System

This project is designed to synchronize multiple LimeSDR-powered nodes using BPSK and dual-tone signaling over RF. It establishes a reliable communication pipeline between a Ground Station, Master Node, and multiple Slave Nodes for frequency offset measurement and calibration.

The system runs on Raspberry Pis (or similar SBCs), each connected to a LimeSDR, and leverages GNU Radio for signal processing.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (Debian-based)
- GNU Radio (3.10+ recommended)
- Python 3.x
- ZMQ, NumPy, SciPy

### Installing GNU Radio
Follow the official installation guide:
https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/InstallingGR

Or use apt:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnuradio

## Getting the Project Files

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/senior-project.git
cd senior-project

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **4. Running the System**
Break this into logical steps like:

```markdown
## Running the System

1. Boot up Raspberry Pi with LimeSDR attached.
2. Ensure GNU Radio is installed and working.
3. Navigate to `ground_station/` to start the Ground node:
```bash
python3 main.py

### üß© **5. How the Pieces Fit Together**
End with a short explanation or a diagram of the big picture.

```markdown
## System Layout

The system uses three types of nodes:

- **Ground**: Sends Master assignment via BPSK.
- **Master**: Sends commands and performs two-tone offset measurements.
- **Slave**: Echoes dual-tone signals and confirms participation.
